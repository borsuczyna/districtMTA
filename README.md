# districtMTA
Full CEF based gamemode for Multi Theft Auto with security-aimed protection, non client-trust!
It's basically **impossible** to cheat on this gamemode.

# Features
- The BEST anti-cheat for MTA + secure server-side, no one has managed to cheat; the only possible action is flying around the map. The server-side is 100% protected, e.g., in a job, the player sends a signal that they entered marker 3213781237812 instead of just requesting money for the job.
