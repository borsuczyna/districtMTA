# districtMTA
Full CEF based gamemode for Multi Theft Auto with security-aimed protection, non client-trust!
It's basically **impossible** to cheat on this gamemode.

# Features
- The BEST anti-cheat for MTA + secure server-side, no one has managed to cheat; the only possible action is flying around the map. The server-side is 100% protected, e.g., in a job, the player sends a signal that they entered marker 3213781237812 instead of just requesting money for the job.  
- Over 300 building models in the San Andreas style, all custom-made and exclusive!  
- 6 cooperative jobs (one for up to 8 players).

- Advanced organizations with rank creation and permission editing (similar to Discord).
